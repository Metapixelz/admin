    - change password/email/username for user
    - add user based permissions and tags
    - set user groups (multiple are possible)

Some thoughts:
- error messages should be caught and shown to the user as toast alert
- generate API client using OpenID schema to always stay up to date
- stay responsive
- keep it simple but modern
  - maybe use chakra ui or material ui
- use good practices for redux or react providers
- maybe stay lightweight with svelte or other
- translate permission variable (i. e. admin.user.view to View Users)
- all actions like delete or ban should require a second confirmation
  - don't use native yes/no diaglog of browser!
  - create component like YesNoDialog and pass actions 
- pagination and search should be on backend side. to support this use tools like react-tables before we have to change all tables in the end
